The emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is a potential paradigm shift for the usage of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). From predominantly a facilitator of information and communication services, the role of ICT in the present age has expanded to the management of objects and resources in the physical world. Thus, it is imperative to devise mechanisms to ensure the trustworthiness of data to secure vulnerable devices against security threats. This work presents an analytical framework based on non-cooperative game theory to evaluate the trustworthiness of individual sensor nodes that constitute the CPS. The proposed game-theoretic model captures the factors impacting the trustworthiness of CPS sensor nodes. Further, the model is used to estimate the Nash equilibrium solution of the game, to derive a trust threshold criterion. The trust threshold represents the minimum trust score â€¦
