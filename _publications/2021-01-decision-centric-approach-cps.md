Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) integrate the interdisciplinary fields of computing, networking and control to perform tasks in the real world. CPSs have recently found applications in many battery-powered devices with stringent energy consumption requirements. To ensure secure operation, CPS necessitates sufficient security mechanisms to be incorporated against cyber attacks. However, maximizing energy efficiency and improving security are desirable but contrasting requirements. Towards reducing energy consumption, the optimal strategy for CPS is to initialize the security mechanism dynamically, at the onset of cyberattacks. In the absence of attacks, CPS can deactivate the security mechanism to minimize energy consumption.
