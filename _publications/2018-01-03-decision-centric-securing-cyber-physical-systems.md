The emerging discipline of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) integrates the interdisciplinary fields of computing, networking, and control to offer solutions to real-world problems. CPS solutions typically include security mechanisms that defend against attack attempts and initiate countermeasures to thwart the attacker's objectives. To minimize the system performance overhead, the optimal decision would be to initialize the security mechanism in response to attack attempts in contrast to sustained operation. In this work, we use Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to decide the threshold upon which the system initiates the security mechanism. The system may be initialized at the threshold to minimize the overall operating costs. The proposed model can be further used to develop a decision-centric security architecture for CPS that balances the trade-off between system performance and security.
