This paper introduces a Self-Learning Hybrid Fuzzy-PID Controller for efficient pressure control in first order hydraulic tank systems. The controller operates in a closed loop system, utilizing a PWM generator to control an ON-OFF valve linked to a hydraulic tank, modeled as a first order system. It features a self-organizing mechanism that automatically adjusts the initial tuning parameters Kp, Ki, and Kd during operation, aligning with the reference signal to eliminate manual readjustment of the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative gains. The model and preliminary analysis were conducted using MATLAB-Simulink, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional PID Control.
